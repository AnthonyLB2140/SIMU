Data sources in VTS
==================================================================================

There are three types of data sources in VTS:

- ``Fixed``: a fixed value
- ``File``: a time-dependent value read from a file
- ``Stream``: a value provided by a network stream


.. _Data_sources_in_VTS#Fixed_data_source:

*Fixed* data source 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This data source provides a constant, user-defined value. The actual value is defined by the user upon selection of the source.

This source can be used eg. for the position and orientation of fixed satellite components and sensors.


.. _Data_sources_in_VTS#File_data_source:

*File* data source 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This data source is based on a file, specified by the user upon selection of the source. The values are read from the file, which must follow the standard :ref:`CIC/CCSDS format <Data_description_for_VTS_projects#The_CIC/CCSDS_file_format>`.

This source can be used for the ephemerides of celestial bodies, satellites, as well as for the position and orientation of mobile parts on satellites.
It is most adequate for *offline* visualization, once the position and attitude data have been saved to files.


.. _Data_sources_in_VTS#Stream_data_source:

*Stream* data source 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This data source is based on a network stream, defined by the user upon selection of the source.

This source can be used for the ephemerides of celestial bodies, satellites, as well as for the position and orientation of mobile parts on satellites.
It is most adequate for *online* visualization, in which the position and attitude data are streamed on-the-fly by external applications, such as a simulator.

The *Stream* data source provides two modes of operation:

- ``INTERPOL``: in order for visualization clients (SurfaceView, Celestia, etc.) to use interpolated values, the Broker will introduce a slight delay between data transmission and time synchronization with visualization clients.
- ``DIRECT``: the data update rate is not taken into account while computing time synchronization delay. Beware that no extrapolation is done in standard VTS clients.

See also the documentation for :ref:`Real-time VTS <Synchronization_protocol_for_VTS_clients#Real-time_VTS>` in the :ref:`Synchronization protocol for VTS clients <Synchronization_protocol_for_VTS_clients>` chapter.
