Starting the VTS configuration utility
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The VTS toolkit can by started by double-clicking the ``startVTS.exe`` file under Windows, or by executing the ``./startVTS`` command under Linux.
This displays the main window of the VTS configuration utility. It allows creating a project by setting up the entities to be visualized: satellites, sensors, ground stations, and client applications.

If the launcher is executed from the command line with the ``--project <ProjectFile.vts>`` argument, the VTS configuration utility automatically loads the given project on startup.


.. _Starting_VTS#Starting_the_visualization_from_the_command_line:

Starting the visualization from the command line
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The visualization can be started automatically from the command line via the launcher. The Broker then opens and starts the visualization, without going through the VTS configuration utility.

In batch mode, the following arguments are mandatory:

- ``--batch`` instructs the launcher to start the Broker directly
- ``--project <ProjectFile.vts>`` specifies the project file to load. The path can be either relative or absolute.

Other command-line arguments for the Broker can also be given in batch mode.

Sample command line: ``startVTS.exe --batch --project C:\Project\CubeSat.vts``

On Linux only, the version of VTS can be obtained with the command: ``./startVTS.exe --version``

If the execution of VTS has a problem, an email could be sent to the Spacebel contact (vts-team@spacebel.fr). The environment being really important to understand, the VTS user can generate the log of environment by clicking on the tab ``Help->System Information...`` from the main interface.  It will produce a ``vtsdiag.log`` in the VTS root project that can be attached to the email.
