.. _Other_visualisable_objects#Positional_covariance_ellipsoid:

Ellipsoid (Positional covariance of a satellite)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The positional covariance can displayed in the 3D view as an ellipsoid representing the uncertainty of an orbit state. It can be defined as a fixed value or as a CIC/CCSDS OEM or MEM file as 3 real values in kilometers. Different reference frames are available (EME2000, BodyFixed, TNW, QSW), relative to the current satellite.

Graphic properties such as visibility, color, transparency, scale can be configured in the scenario state editor.

.. _Other_visualisable_objects#Grid_Visualizer:

Grid
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A grid displays 3 different planes (XY, YZ, XZ) and can be attached to a satellite. It is defined with a grid size (Xmin, Ymin, Xmax, Ymax for each plane) and a cell size (spacing between lines defined as width and height). All units are in kilometers. 

The visualizer is attached to its parent entity, and aligned to the a reference frame defined by a center entity and a frame type (EME2000, BodyFixed, TNW, QSW).

Graphic properties such as visibility, labels, color, transparency, can be configured in the scenario state editor.

.. _Other_visualisable_objects#SphericalShell_Visualizer:

Spherical Shell
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A spherical shell is a generalization of an annulus to three dimensions. It is the region of a ball between two concentric spheres of differing radii. It is defined with 3 dimensions [latitude min, latitude max] in degrees, [longitude min, longitude max] in degrees, [altitude min, altitude max] in kilometers, and a step size for the grid cells for each dimension.

The visualizer is attached to its parent entity, and aligned to the a reference frame defined by a center entity and a frame type (EME2000, BodyFixed, TNW, QSW).

Graphic properties such as visibility, labels, color, transparency, can be configured in the scenario state editor.
