Application IDs in VTS
======================

Application IDs in a VTS visualization uniquely identify any client application taking part in the visualization.

There are three classes of application IDs: project IDs, dynamic IDs, and external IDs. The distinction between the three is merely used to quickly determine the origin of an application, and is not required to be strictly followed.

- **Project IDs** are attributed in sequence by the VTS configuration utility when adding a new client application to the project. The ID is chosen as the first available (i.e. not already attributed) application ID, starting from 1.
- **Dynamic IDs** are attributed in sequence by the Broker when starting a new client application for the visualization. The ID is chosen as the first available (i.e. not already attributed) application ID, starting from 100.
- **External IDs** are attributed in sequence by the Broker upon connection of a new client, if it was not started by the Broker and requires automatic attribution of an ID (by passing the ``-1`` ID in the ``INIT`` message sent to the Broker by the client). The ID is chosen as the first available (i.e. not already attributed) application ID, starting from 1000.
