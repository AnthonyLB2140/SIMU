Structure of satellites in VTS
==================================================================================

The structure of satellites in VTS matches the organization of the elements composing a satellite.

This structure can be found in:

- the VTS configuration utility, in the tree hierarchy displayed in the left pane. Refer to the :ref:`VTS configuration utility user manual <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual>` chapter.
- the contents of the project file. Refer to the :ref:`VTS project file format <VTS_project_file_format>` chapter.
- the *View Properties* and *3D Cameras* tabs of the Broker. Refer to the :ref:`Broker user manual <Broker_user_manual>` chapter.

The structure can be described as follows:

- A project contains central bodies and satellites
- A satellite is composed of a main component which defines the body of the satellite.
- A component may contain sensors.
- A component may contain sub-components.
- These sub-components may themselves contain sub-components.

The naming scheme of objects relies on this structure, e.g. ``Sol/Earth/CubeSat/GS``. See also the chapter about :ref:`Object paths in VTS <Object_paths_in_VTS>`.

**NB:** Throughout this documentation and the VTS GUI, satellite components are sometimes referred to as "subparts".
