Physical masks in VTS
==================================================================================

A physical mask describes irregularities of the aiming volume of a ground station due to obstacles (relief, buildings, ...). It applies to the full visibility area (no minimal elevation angle).

Mask point coordinates describe the contour of a closed shape in elevation/azimuth. To represent a line of sight, it's necessary to close to the surface along the horizon. Using this convention, any shape can be represented as a mask.

CIC/CCSDS mask file format
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Masks are defined in CIC/CCSDS files in MPM format. For more information on the CIC/CCSDS file format, refer to the :ref:`CIC-CCSDS data files in VTS <CIC-CCSDS_data_files_in_VTS>` chapter.

A CIC/CCSDS mask file must have the following characteristics:

- The ``USER_DEFINED_PROTOCOL`` must be ``NONE``.
- The ``USER_DEFINED_CONTENT`` may be arbitrary.
- The ``USER_DEFINED_SIZE`` must be ``2``.
- The ``USER_DEFINED_TYPE`` must be ``REAL``.
- The ``USER_DEFINED_UNIT`` must be ``[deg]``.

The data values in the file are coordinates in elevation/azimuth.

In masks files, the special data value ``180 180`` is interpreted as a separator and will create a new polygon with the following sequence of coordinates.
