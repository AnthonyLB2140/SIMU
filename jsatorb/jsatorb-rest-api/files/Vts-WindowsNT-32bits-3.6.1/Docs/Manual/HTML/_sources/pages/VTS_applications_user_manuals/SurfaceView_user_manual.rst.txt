- *Satellite / Sun / Celestial bodies ground track*
   The ground tracks of the sun, satellites and other celestial bodies appear before and after each entity. 
   Their lengths can be defined in the VTS configuration utility. 
   In SurfaceView, the tracks are displayed in the body's local frame (as opposed to an inertial frame in Celestia).
- *Satellite / Celestial bodies visibility region*
   The visibility regions of satellites and other celestial bodies is the region of the earth visible from the current position of the entity. 
   Their graphic properties can be defined in the VTS configuration utility.

.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Configuration_in_VTS:

Configuration in VTS 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The entities and properties defined in the VTS configuration utility will be displayed in SurfaceView. The main body can be defined using the initial parameters of the application, otherwise the first central body defined in the VTS project tree will be used. Refer to the :ref:`Configuring a central body <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual#Configuring_a_central_body>` section in the :ref:`VTS configuration utility user manual <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual>` chapter for more information. 


.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Application_parameters_in_VTS:

Application parameters in VTS 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When adding SurfaceView as a VTS client application, some parameters can be set by clicking on the SurfaceView entry in the VTS project tree:

.. figure:: /_images/SurfaceViewApplicationParameters.png
   :align: center

- *Scene Reference*
   This combo box allows you to select the main body from the list of celestial bodies defined in the VTS project tree.
   The selected body will become the scene reference and in the SurfaceView instance and the position of all other entities will be projected on it.
   By default, the first body from the VTS project tree is selected as a scene reference.
- *Map Projection*
   This combo box allows you to select the world map projection that will be used in the SurfaceView instance.
   Currently supported projections are Equirectangular (plate carree), Mercator and Polar.
- *Target framerate*
   The application target framerate (frames per seconds).
   A higher value improves the accuracy but slows down the application.
   An accurate simulation can be achieved with a framerate of 40, however framerates higher than 50 will make little difference in the accuracy.
- *Track sampling resolution*
   This parameter allows you to modify the sampling resolution of all the tracks in VTS.
   Tracks represent the trajectory of different objects (satellites, celestial bodies, stars).
   Decrease this value to improve track accuracy at the expense of performance degradation.
- *Sensor geometry section count*
   Number of points making up the outline polygon of the aiming sensor surface.
   Increase this parameter if you want to focus on sensor swath accuracy.
   Decrease it for long missions coverage to improve performance.
- *Sensor coverage significant threshold*
   The sensor swath is composed by a set of instantaneous sensor aiming surfaces represented by polygons.
   An instantaneous aiming surface is retained when a significant percentage of new coverage is provided by the new surface.
   This parameter sets the percentage of novelty (minimum threshold).

   - Use a small value for an agile satellite.
   - Use a high value for a long coverage mission.

   .. figure:: /_images/DefautSignificantThreshold.png
      :align: center

      A significant threshold of 5% of novelty is ideal for an agile satellite maneuver.

   .. figure:: /_images/DefautSignificantThreshold2.png
      :align: center

      A small threshold works well for long coverage missions but slows down the display.

   .. figure:: /_images/HighSignificantThreshold.png
      :align: center

      A significant threshold of 40% gives poor results during agile satellite maneuvers.

   .. figure:: /_images/HighSignificantThreshold.png
      :align: center

      A high threshold gives good results for long coverage missions with good performance.

   **This parameter has no effect if the Sensor coverage nadir optimization is enabled.**
- *Sensor coverage merging threshold*
   The sensor residual trace is composed by many polygons. 
   Its length is maintained by deleting polygons at the end of the tail. 
   For better performance, polygons are merged together when two polygons have at least a certain percentage of area in common. 
   This parameter sets the percentage of novelty (minimum threshold).

   - Choose a small value when the length of the sensor residual trace must be accurate (0% of merging will keep all polygons separated).
   - Choose a high value for better performance (99% of merging will merge huge blocks of polygons, which will be removed one by one, making the residual trace length vary a lot).
   - Choose the special value of 100% to only merge by orbit path color : this mode is useful for long coverage missions, where only the current orbit pass should be displayed.

   **This parameter has no effect if the Sensor coverage nadir optimization is enabled.**
- *Sensor coverage nadir optimization*
   For satellites pointing nadir, this optimization improves significantly the performance of the sensor coverage calculation at the cost of reducing the accuracy: the computed coverage is less accurate but the simulation is faster and it shows satellites coverages overlap. 
   If the optimization is disabled, the sensor coverage will follow the exact sensor surface.

   **If the optimization is enabled, the Sensor coverage significant threshold and Sensor coverage merging threshold parameters will have no effect in the application.**

   Refer to the :ref:`Coverage swath <SurfaceView_user_manual#Coverage_swath>` section for more information.


.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Coverage_swath:

Coverage swath 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SurfaceView has an option to optimize the coverage swath of satellites pointing nadir.

Without the nadir optimization, the sensor coverage is exact because the sensor surface is used as a stamp. However, the coverage could be incomplete if the time ratio is high enough (some sensor stamps will be missed). By the default, the coverage is kept in memory during one hour.

With the nadir optimization, the sensor coverage will be always complete even if the time ratio is high and it will allow the simulation of a higher number of satellites' coverages without slowing down the application. However, the accuracy of the coverage can be reduced at the poles or if the satellite is not pointing nadir. The nadir optimization is enabled by default.

.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Map_Projections:

Map Projections 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently SurfaceView supports the following projections: 


- Equirectangular projection (*plate carree*)
- Mercator
- Polar

Each SurfaceView instance can be configured with a different projection using from the initial parameters of the application. Please refer to :ref:`Application parameters in VTS <SurfaceView_user_manual#Application_parameters_in_VTS>`.

.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Tile_map:

Tile map 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tilemap mechanism allows you to load and display high definition maps as background images, depending on the zoom level. The tilemap is configured by a local URL pointing to a multi-level image hierarchy or a WMS server.

Please refer to :ref:`Tile Map textures <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual#Tile_Map_textures>` for more information about local or WMS tile maps.

When using a WMS tile map, in SurfaceView, the following parameters will be automatically added according the current zoom level.


- Latitude/longitude tile's border coordinates: ``&BBOX=<west>,<south>,<east>,<north>``
- Tile size in pixels: ``&WIDTH=<width>&HEIGHT=<height>``

.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Clusters:

Clusters
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clusters are used to display a large population of objects. Information about each object can be displayed in real-time.

.. figure:: /_images/SurfaceViewClusterInfo.png
   :align: center

   Information about an object of the population

User can configure it by editing the following parameters:

- *Cluster visibility*: 
   String defining a partial or a total visibility of the cluster. Allowed strings are :

   - ``all``: all objects are visible

   - ``none``: all objects are hidden

   - ``all except obj1, obj2, ..., objN``: all objects are visible except the objects specified in the list (comma-separated object names)

   - ``none except obj1, obj2, ..., objN``: all objects are hidden except the objects specified in the list (comma-separated object names)

Cursor coordinates 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cursor coordinates can be displayed by pressing the ``SHIFT`` key. The coordinates expressed in latitude/longitude are displayed in the window status bar.

Use ``SHIFT`` + ``left click`` to copy the cursor coordinates into the clipboard. 
When the ``Edit mode`` is active, the points are kept after the release of ``SHIFT``, so that more points can be accumulated. 
When the ``Normal mode`` is active, the points are cleaned after the release of ``SHIFT``. Added new points will reset the previous points in the clipboard.

You can copy multiple coordinates by maintaining the ``SHIFT`` key pressed and left clicking on different locations. The distance between the selected points is also displayed in the status bar. The locations marks will remain visible until the SHIFT key is released. This is useful to create a POI/ROI as the coordinates can be directly pasted in the POI/ROI file.

.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Projection_center:

Projection center 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to shift the longitude coordinate of the map projection's center and thus to center the scene at a meridian other than the prime meridian (Greenwich). 

This is achieved by holding the ``CTRL`` key while dragging the background image. The coordinates of the projection center are displayed in the window status bar.

.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Orthodromic_measures:

Orthodromic measures 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create measures in SurfaceView using one of the three availables tools, described below. The ``LEFT`` button of the mouse is used to create measures. 

The three measuring tools proposed by SurfaceView are:

- **Single Measures** (F6) : allows creating orthodromic measures from points to points.

.. figure:: /_images/SurfaceViewSingleMeasuresScreen.png
   :align: center



- **Chained Measures** (F7) : allows creating chained measures : the end point of a measure becomes the beginning point of the next measure.

.. figure:: /_images/SurfaceViewChainedMeasuresScreen.png
   :align: center



- **Central Measures** (F8) : allows creating central measures : all measures a done from the same first "central" point.

.. figure:: /_images/SurfaceViewCentralMeasuresScreen.png
   :align: center


Pressing ``F9`` clears all the measures.

.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Centering_lock:

Centering lock 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Clicking on a satellite, a station or any celestial body will center and lock the view on that entity during the animation. Zoom actions are also centered on the entity instead of the mouse cursor. Clicking the map unlocks the view.


.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Geographical_coordinates:

Geographical coordinates 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Hovering the mouse over a satellite, ground station or celestial body, will display a tooltip containing the geographical coordinates of the entity.

These coordinates are computed by VTS and are approximate, especially when computing the longitude near the poles.

.. figure:: /_images/2dWinZoom.png
   :align: center



.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Moving_the_time:

Moving the time 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Sun, satellites and celestial bodies defined in the VTS project have a **ground track** associated which can be used to drag the entity along it in order to move forwards or backwards in time. The dragged entity automatically snaps to the nearest point of its ground track. The corresponding date is sent to the Broker and all applications are synchronized.

.. figure:: /_images/DragSun.png
   :align: center


It is possible to "jump" from orbit to orbit if the ground track is long enough (for example, greater than the period of the satellite's orbit). This results in a similar "jump" in visualization time.

Dragging satellites near track intersections can become very "unstable" (typically near the poles, or if the track time window is greater than the period of the satellite's orbit). The satellite may "jump" from orbit to orbit depending on the position and movement of the mouse. It is advised to avoid dragging a satellite in these areas if "jumping" from orbit to orbit is not desired.

*Note that visualization time is automatically paused when dragging an entity*.


.. _SurfaceView_user_manual#Mission_events:

Mission events 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SurfaceView displays mission events attached to satellites and allows some interaction with them. The events are displayed along the satellite's ground track at the corresponding date of the event. Refer to the :ref:`Events attached to a satellite <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual#Events_attached_to_a_satellite>` section in the :ref:`VTS configuration utility user manual <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual>` chapter for more information.

The line segment linking the icon of an event to its actual position on the satellite ground track is the same color (only a bit lighter) as that of the satellite ground track.

The name of all events are always displayed if the *All event text visibility* parameter is checked in the Broker.

The visibility of all event types can be controlled from the *Events* tab of the Broker. Refer to the :ref:`*Events* tab <Broker_user_manual#Events_tab>` section of the :ref:`Broker user manual <Broker_user_manual>` chapter for more information.

The appearance of mission events can be defined in the *Event Type Editor* tab of the VTS configuration utility. Refer to the :ref:`Configuring event types <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual#Configuring_event_types>` section in the :ref:`VTS configuration utility user manual <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual>` chapter for more information.

- **Hovering**: Hovering above a single event will display a tooltip containing the name of the satellite the event is attached to, the name of the event, as well as additional data provided by the CIC/CCSDS event file.
   - Events at the exact same date -- or at dates close enough that they appear to be at the same date at the current zoom level -- will animate and split when the mouse is hovered above them.
- **Double-click**: Double-clicking an event will set the current visualization time to the date of the event. The satellite then appears located at the position of the event. The visualization is also paused.

SurfaceView uses the VTS ephemeris catalog to display an accurate positioning and Sun terminator (see the [Central bodies in VTS] section for more information about ephemeris origin). For custom positioning or unsupported bodies, suitable ephemerides files will need to be provided to override the catalog ones. Refer to the :ref:`Position and orientation of a body <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual#Position_and_orientation_of_a_body>` section of the :ref:`VTS configuration utility user manual <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual>` chapter for more information.

Central body texture 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The current architecture of the SurfaceView application enforces a few constraints:

- The *built-in* texture for Earth is embedded in SurfaceView. It is based on the Blue Marble photos from NASA (`image link <https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/collection/1484/blue-marble>`_ , `documentation link <http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/bmng.pdf>`_).
- For other solar system bodies or celestial bodies available in Celestia, the *built-in* texture will be taken from Celestia, using the equidistant cylindrical (plate carree) projection.
- For bodies not available in Celestia, a black texture will appear in *built-in* mode. A custom texture should then be defined. Refer to the :ref:`Texture of a body <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual#Texture_of_a_body>` section of the :ref:`VTS configuration utility user manual <VTS_configuration_utility_user_manual>` chapter for more information.
