Clusters in VTS
==================================================================================

In VTS, a cluster represents a population of objects. The objects aren't directly exposed to user
in the configurator.

Each object consists of a name and an orbit file.

A cluster is attached to a central body which will be used as a reference frame to position the different objects.
