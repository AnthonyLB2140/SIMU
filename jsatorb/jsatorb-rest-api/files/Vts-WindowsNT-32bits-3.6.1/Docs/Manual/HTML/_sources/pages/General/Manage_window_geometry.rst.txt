Window Geometry Manager
=======================

.. |icon| image:: /_images/window-manager.png

VTS client applications can be arranged via the Window Geometry Manager. This tool is available by clicking on the *Manage window geometry* button (|icon|) from the **Scenario Editor** tab or from the **VTS Broker**.

The Window Geometry Manager is divided into four sections :

- The left section (red) contains the list of all VTS client application defined in the VTS project or used during the visualization as dynamic application.
- The top-right section (violet) is used to display information and help about the tool.
- The middle-right section (green) shows the system's screen configuration as detected by VTS and the position of each client application window. A grid is displayed to help arrange the position of the windows. The resolution of the grid can be configured via VTS's **Settings dialog**.
- The bottom-right section (blue) contains options to arrange client application windows automatically. There are as many **Fullscreen** buttons as screens detected and they are ordered from the top-left screen to the bottom-right screen.


Change the order of stacked windows
-----------------------------------

The order of stacked window can be change by dragging up and down application items in the list in the left section. The feature can fail if a client application doesn't implement the "CMD SERVICE ActivateWindow" protocol command.

Clicking on an application item will also raise or activate the corresponding application.


Contextual menu actions
-----------------------

A right click on the left section list will show the available actions :

- *Activate all windows*: raise and activate all applications (needs :ref:`"ActivateWindow" <Description_of_application_properties#Application_properties_guidelines>` protocol command implementation)
- *Activate selected windows*: raise and activate selected application (needs :ref:`"ActivateWindow" <Description_of_application_properties#Application_properties_guidelines>` protocol command implementation)
- *Toggle always on top*: Change the state property for the always on top flag (needs the :ref:`"AlwaysOnTop" <Description_of_application_properties#Application_properties_guidelines>` application property implementation)
- *Toggle frameless*: Change the state property for the always on top flag (needs the :ref:`"Frameless" <Description_of_application_properties#Application_properties_guidelines>` application property implementation)

The **order of stacked windows** can be change by dragging up and down application items in the list in the left section. The feature can fail if a client application doesn't implement the :ref:`"ActivateWindow" protocol command <Description_of_application_properties#Application_properties_guidelines>`.


Arrange client applications windows
-----------------------------------

In order to organize the visualization, it requires two actions:

- Area selection: select an area in one of the screen grids. A preview of the selected area will be briefly displayed in the screen. The entire screen can be selected using the corresponding **Fullscreen** button.

- Application selection: select an application from the list. Multiple applications can be selected using ``Ctrl`` key while clicking.

When both and **area** and an **one or more applications** are selected, the geometry of the selected application(s) will be modified to cover the selected area.

If several applications are selected they will be overlapped in the order of the selection. They can also be arranged in an horizontal or vertical layout proportionnaly using the **Layout** buttons. Clicking  one more time will remove the layout (windows will return to the overlapped layout).

An example is shown below:

.. figure:: /_images/WindowGeometryInterfaceUsage_1.png
   :align: center

Click the **Fullscreen** "2" button and then select applications #1, #2 and #3. Applications windows are shown overlapped on screen 2.

   :align: center

Click vertical layout button to arrange windows vertically.
   
.. figure:: /_images/WindowGeometryInterfaceUsage_3.png
   :align: center

Click horizontal layout button to arrange windows horizontally.
   
.. figure:: /_images/WindowGeometryInterfaceUsage_4.png
   :align: center

Click cascade layout button to arrange windows horizontally.

.. note::
   The "cascade layout", not visible in the above screenshots, will try to arrange windows as a cascade. It might fail if some applications don't implement the :ref:`"ActivateWindow" protocol command <Description_of_application_properties#Application_properties_guidelines>`.
