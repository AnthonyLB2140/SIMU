Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data files used by VTS and its client applications are written in the CIC/CCSDS format, a column-based text format derived from the CCSDS OEM, AEM and MPM formats.

The CIC/CCSDS file format is described in the reference document *CIC Data Exchange Protocol V2.0* (DCT/DA/PA - 2009.0021267). This document is included in the VTS root directory. You will also find many examples of CIC/CCSDS files in the "Data" directory.

Some features of the CIC/CCSDS file format:

- Standardized header depending on file type
- Data as timestamped lines
- MJD date format with 2 fields respectively for days and seconds (see the :ref:`Date formats in VTS <Date_formats_in_VTS>` section)
- Satellite position in kilometers
- Orientation as quaternions from EME2000 towards satellite local frame
- Heterogeneous data units within the same file

VTS handles World Geodetic System (WGS84) in SurfaceView.

Heterogeneous data units
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CCSDS files can store data with multiple units. This allows for the use of data such as Lat/Long/Alt (degrees, degrees, meters).
When explicitly specified, the unit is defined in the ``USER_DEFINED_UNIT`` field of the CCSDS header, enclosed by square brackets.

Multiple units can be defined by putting pipes between different units. The order of the units corresponds to the order of the data columns.


.. code-block:: bash

   USER_DEFINED_UNIT = [deg|deg|m]
