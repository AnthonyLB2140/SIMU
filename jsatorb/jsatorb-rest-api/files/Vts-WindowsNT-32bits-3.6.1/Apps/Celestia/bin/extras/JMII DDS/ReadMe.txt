To install in Celestia-unzip and put 'JMII DDS' folder in your 'extras' folder.
Too see it in Celestia you must right click on Earth and select
Alternate Surfaces-JMII DDS
it is a little slow in loading the different levels but well worth the wait.
I made this VT from the Nasa Blue Marble textures.The original source files can be found at 
ftp://mitch.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/stockli/bluemarble/
Here you will find various different maps of the Earth and because Photoshop can only open
images smaller than 30000 pixels they are split into 2 halves (East and West hemisphere).
So together they have a resolution of 43200x21600 pixels or 1km/pixel.
For this texture I have used the files
MOD09A1.E.interpol.cyl.retouched.topo.bathymetry.3X21600x21600.gz
MOD09A1.W.interpol.cyl.retouched.topo.bathymetry.3X21600x21600.gz
to give some indication of sea depths and add a bit of variation to the oceans
but superimposed the flat sea colour from the following files
MOD09A1.E.interpol.cyl.retouched.topo.3X21600x21600.gz
MOD09A1.W.interpol.cyl.retouched.topo.3X21600x21600.gz
so the oceans dont appear to be transparent.I have also toned down the saturation of these 
textures as it looked too much.
I have made this texture DDS (DXT3) and includes a 32k Specular Map
I have included in the ssc ,lines for the inclusion of my Night and Normal textures,
it should work fine without having these installed,but if you download these put them all
in the Celestia/extras/JMII DDS/textures/hires  folder together with their ctx files.
If you dont like the colours you can try changing the haze and specular settings in the JMII DDS.ssc
