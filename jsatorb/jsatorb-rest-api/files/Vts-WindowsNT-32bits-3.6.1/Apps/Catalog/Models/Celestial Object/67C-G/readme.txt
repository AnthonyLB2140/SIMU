It is the destination of the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft mission, launched on 2 March 2004, which "woke up" from hibernation mode on 20 January 2014 to monitor the comet and select a suitable site for an attempted landing in November 2014 by its Philae lander. The comet will next come to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on August 13, 2015.
