------------------------------------------------
Solar system bodies ephemerides / orientations 
(CNES - DCT/SB/MS)
------------------------------------------------

Planets: 
"Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune" 

Frame = ICRF (origin = Sun) 

Model used for ephemerides: 
VSOP87: version available in CelestLab with option "high accuracy" (not the maximum accuracy)

Orientation: 
Compliant with IERS 2010 for Earth
Compliant with: "Report of the IAU/IAG working group on cartographic 
  coordinates and rotational elements - 2009" for planets other than Earth

Position accuracy: 
- about 4 arcsec in direction (from frame origin)
- about 0.002% in distance (from frame origin)

Time system : TAI
