SkyView

The SkyView application displays a rectangular star chart centered on a specific satellite.

Parameter description:

- Scene Reference: allows you to select which satellite will be used as the scene reference.

- Cartesian precision display: number of digits displayed after the comma for cartesian coordinates (limited to 10).

- Geographic precision display: number of digits displayed after the comma for geographic coordinates (limited to 10).

- Map Projection: allows you to select the celestial sphere projection.

- Min visible star count: the minimum number of stars displayed.

- Loaded star count from catalog: the number of stars to load from the specified star catalog.

- Target framerate: the application framerate per second. Higher values improve accuracy but slow down the application.

- Track sampling resolution: sampling resolution of object's tracks (satellites, bodies, etc.). Decrease this value to improve track accuracy at the expense of performance degradation.

- Sensor geometry section count: the number of points making up the outline polygon of the aiming sensor surface.

- Sensor coverage significant threshold (%): the sensor swath is composed by a sequence of instantaneous sensor aiming surfaces, a surface is retained when it exceeds this significant threshold of novelty.

- Sensor coverage merging threshold (%): the sensor swath is composed by many polygons which are merged together when they exceeds this fusion threshold of area in common.
