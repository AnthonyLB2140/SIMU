ZenithView

The ZenithView application takes a ground station as a reference and presents a zenith view from this station using a Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection.

Parameter description:

- Scene Reference: allows you to select which ground station will be used as the scene reference.

- Cartesian precision display: number of digits displayed after the comma for cartesian coordinates (limited to 10).

- Geographic precision display: number of digits displayed after the comma for geographic coordinates (limited to 10).

- Min visible star count: the minimum number of stars displayed.

- Loaded star count from catalog: the number of stars to load from the specified star catalog.

- Target framerate: the application framerate per second. Higher values improve accuracy but slow down the application.

- Track sampling resolution: sampling resolution of object's tracks (satellites, bodies, etc.). Decrease this value to improve track accuracy at the expense of performance degradation.

- Project on horizon when outside the view : If true, entities whose projection are outside the limits of the current view (i.e. a satellite not visible from the ground station) will be displayed on the horizon of the view.

- Projection field of view : The field of view of the projection in degrees.

- Station-satellite links text font: font used for the link between station and satellite.

- Station-satellite links text format: determines the format of the string for the link between station and satellite:
    ${elevation} represents the elevation angle,
    ${azimuth} represents the azimuth angle,
    ${distance} represents the distance between the station and the satellite.
  Example:
    El:${elevation}째 Az:${azimuth}째 (${distance} km)  El:16.5151째 Az:-3.79313째 (1798.12 km)
