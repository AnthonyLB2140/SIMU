# List of Attitudes
This is a list of standard attitudes that can be used.

In options["ATTITUDE"], "law": "LOF_LVLH" for example

## LOF (Local Orbital Frame)
### "LOF_LVLH"
Constant for Local Vertical, Local Horizontal frame (X axis aligned with position, Z axis aligned with orbital momentum).
### "LOF_QSW"
Constant for QSW frame (X axis aligned with position, Z axis aligned with orbital momentum).
### "LOF_TNW"
Constant for TNW frame (X axis aligned with velocity, Z axis aligned with orbital momentum).
### "LOF_VNC"
Constant for Velocity - Normal - Co-normal frame (X axis aligned with velocity, Y axis aligned with orbital momentum).
### "LOF_VVLH"
Constant for Vehicle Velocity, Local Horizontal frame (Z axis aligned with opposite of position, Y axis aligned with opposite of orbital momentum).

## Body center Pointing: "POINTING_CENTRAL"
Z axis pointing towards central body

## Sun Pointing: "POINTING_SUN"
Z axis pointing towards Sun

## Nadir Pointing: "NADIR"
Z axis pointing towards the vertical of the ground point under satellite
