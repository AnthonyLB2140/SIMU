# List of plot types for COVERAGE

## "PERCENT_COV"
Percent coverage: shows how much of the total time of the simulation a given point on the ground is covered.

## "TIME_AV_GAP"
Time average gap: average length of the gap we would find if we randomly sampled the system.

## "MAX_GAP"
Maximum gap: longest of the coverage gaps encountered for any individual point.

## "MEAN_GAP"
Mean coverage gap: average length of breaks in coverage for a given point.

## "MEAN_RESP_TIME"
Mean response time: average time from when we receive a random request to observe a point until we can observe it.
